# Pico-Nunchuck
This project demonstrates how to interface with a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck using the I2C protocol on a Raspberry Pi Pico. Though I'm still learning so it's not the best. This work is heavily inspired by [Infusion's Nunchuk Fritzing project](https://github.com/infusion/Fritzing/tree/master/Nunchuk).

## Features
- Reads and prints joystick positions and accelerometer values.
- Reads the state of buttons C and Z on the Nunchuck.
